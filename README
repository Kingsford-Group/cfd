Conserved Feature Discovery 
(software for the manuscript "A statistical method for identifying consistently important features across conditions")

CFD itself is implemented in Go (source code is in the go/src/ directory), and figures for the manuscript were generated in Python, using the produce_manuscript_figures.py code.

conservationdiscovery is an executable that should not require Go installation to run, with the following options:
Usage of ./conservationdiscovery:
  -i string
        list of input files, separated by commas or one input file containing all data as columns
  -t string
        type of input - f if file containing list of filenames, s if filestring for glob
  -o string
        filename for outputs

example usages:
./conservationdiscovery -i=datafiles/gtexsamples_thresh80.txt -t=f -o=outputs/gtex/cfd_gtex_ongenes_thresh80.txt
./conservationdiscovery -i="HumanBodyMapRNAseq/salmonout/*/genequant.sf" -t=s -o=outputs/humanbodymap/cfd_hbm_ongenes.txt

The SupplementalData directory contains 4 files: one for the housekeeping genes on each of GTEx and the Human Body Map data, and one for the full GO enrichment results on each data set.

The makesimulationdata.py is the script used to generate simulation data from the manuscript.
